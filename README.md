# 🧪 MATLAB Simulations – Elevate_PLC_Control

## 📊 Elevator Physics & Control Investigation

This branch is dedicated to **simulation and control modeling** of complex elevator systems using **MATLAB and Simulink**. It serves as a testing ground for **PID controller development**, **multi-floor motion profiles**, and **realistic physics-based behavior** prior to simpler hardware implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔬 Investigate advanced elevator car dynamics beyond ideal linear motion
- ⚙️ Simulate force-based motion including:
  - Mass, gravity, friction, and counterweight effects
- 🧠 Design and tune **PID controllers** for position and velocity control
- 📈 Analyze system response to step changes and floor transitions
